# Java_4_Media-Catalog

An application that can manage a catalog of multimedia items. An entry in this catalog might be a song, a movie, a book or any item that has at least a name and a path in the local file system. (at the moment only the Track and Movie archetypes are implemented)

The .bat file simply launches the .jar in the corresponding folder. 

The save command creates a saveFile.txt which stores the objects of the list(serialized), so they can later be restored.
